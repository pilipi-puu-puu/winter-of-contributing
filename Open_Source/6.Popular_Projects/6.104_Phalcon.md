# <center><b>What is Phalcon?</b></center>
Phalcon is an open source full stack framework for PHP, written as a C-extension. Phalcon is optimized for high performance. Its unique architecture allows the framework to always be memory resident, offering its functionality whenever its needed, without expensive file stats and file reads that traditional PHP frameworks employ.


# Phalcon Features
* It is the fastest framework for PHP.
* It is a full stack open source framework.
* It can create independent framework.
* It requires less amount of code for specific task implementation.
* It provides ORM, templating engine, routing, caching etc.
* It is a loosely coupled framework, user can build a project with a directory structure as per the application requirement.


# Phalcon performance
The motivation behind Phalcon development was to create an extension to a web server that enhances execution speeds, reduces resource utilization, and ensures higher request processing compared to other PHP frameworks.

The biggest competitive advantage of Phalcon is efficient memory utilization. This eradicates the need to keep any information off-memory, while most of the other PHP frameworks utilize file reads and file stats that are expensive operations. By eliminating the need for them, Phalcon optimizes performance and enhances efficiency.

# Phalcon vs Larvel
Even though Laravel is widely regarded as a top choice for a PHP framework, it canâ€™t compete with Phalcon when it comes down to speed, scalability, and performance.

| Larvel      | Phalcon |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Laravel supports all relational databases. | Phalcon gives equal support to relational and non-relational databases   |
| Laravel is written in PHP and follows MVC pattern.   | Phalcon includes both PHP and C.  |
| Performance is high but less in comparison with Phalcon.   | High performance  |
| Laravel is used for building web applications.   | Phalcon is used to design variety of projects.  |

#Application Structure of Phalcon

Phalcon key feature is that it is a loosely coupled framework. Phalcon allows user to build project with a directory structure that is convenient for specific application. It follows MVC and has "Standard Structure". Phalcon has the following directory structure for a project:

Phalcon consist of object oriented classes to implement MVC architecture. MVC is a framework which is used to develop web frameworks and desktop applications. Some advantages are:

> * Business logic is isolated from database and user interface layer.
> * Very easy maintenance of code as different section is created for difficult codes.
